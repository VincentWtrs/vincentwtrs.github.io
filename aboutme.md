I am active as a data scientist at KBC Bank & Insurance Belgium since September 2018 where I have been leveraging the power of machine learning to create additional value in several domains. My expertise lies in investments (AI-driven trading; optimization), real estate (valuation), chatbot design and customer relationship management. I have been involved in all stages of AI-powered projects from scoping to delivery and maintanance. A short list of some of my achievements at KBC:

* AI-driven Investment Fund ('Enhanced Intelligence Fund') - The first Belgian AI-driven fund
* Customer Relationship Management using AI
* Real Estate Valuation Tool - automatic valuation of any land, apartment or house based on an address.
* Bolero Matti - Robo-advisor for exchange traded funds (ETFs)
* KBC Kate Chatbot - Personal assistent in the KBC Smartphone application using natural language processing

Next to my full-time job at KBC, I take up teaching occasionally, this year, I have co-taught a Machine Learning with Python course at the Statistics Summer School of the Flemish universities in September for the second time. Here we start from linear models and why fail in complex situations and move all the way up to deep learning in 5 half days. Next to this, I also give guest lectures for Universities/Management Schools or student organizations.
