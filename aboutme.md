I am currently working as a data scientist at KBC Bank & Insurance since September 2018. I have been designing and building data-driven solutions for various areas such as investments and financial markets, marketing, real estate and chatbot design. My involvement spans over all stages from scoping to delivery and maintenance. A short selection of projects I have worked on:

* AI-driven Investment Fund [('Enhanced Intelligence Fund')](https://www.kbc.be/private-banking/en/portfolio-management/investment-instruments/funds/artificial-intelligence-fund.html) - The first Belgian AI-driven fund
* Generative AI for Insurance backoffice automatization
* Customer Relationship Management using AI
* [Real Estate Valuation Tool](https://newsroom.kbc.com/another-brick-in-the-wall-the-belgian-urge-to-build-their-own-home) - data-driven valuation of land, apartment or house based on a Belgian address
* [Bolero Matti](https://www.boleromatti.be/nl) - Robo-advisor for exchange traded funds (ETFs)
* KBC Kate Chatbot - Personal assistent in the KBC Smartphone application using natural language processing

Next to my full-time job at KBC, I teach an introductory course "Machine Learning with Python" at the [FLAMES](https://www.flames-statistics.com/) Institute for statistics from the Flemish universities during their yearly [Summer School](https://www.flames-statistics.com/summerschool) since 2021.
